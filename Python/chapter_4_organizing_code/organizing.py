# Chapter 4: "Organizing Code: Functions üì¶ (Reusable Code Blocks)"

# Namaste Developer bhai! Chapter 4 mein aapka phir se swagat hai.
# Iss chapter mein, hum seekhenge ki code ko organize kaise karna hai functions use karke.
# Functions are like 'code packages' - reusable blocks of code that do specific tasks.
# Think of it like organizing your tools in a workshop üß∞. Each tool (function) has a specific job.

# ---

# ### 4.1 What are Functions? Code Packages üì¶ (Named Actions)

# **Concept:** Functions are like mini-programs inside your main program.
# They are blocks of code that do a specific job and you can reuse them many times.
# Think of them as 'code packages' that you can use again and again.

# **Analogy:** Pre-fabricated Component Modules üì¶ in a Manufacturing Plant üè≠

# Imagine a factory making cars üöó. They don't build every part from scratch every time.
# They use pre-made parts like engines, wheels, etc. Functions are like these pre-made parts for your code.

# *   **Function Definition as Module Creation üì¶:**
#     Defining a function is like creating a blueprint for a pre-made part.
#     You decide what it does, what it needs as input, and what it gives as output.

# *   **Function Call as Module Utilization üõ†Ô∏è:**
#     Using a function (calling it) is like taking a pre-made part and fitting it into your car.
#     You can use the same part (function) as many times as you want, in different places.

# **Explanation Breakdown (Technical Precision):**

# *   **`def` keyword - Function Declaration Syntax:**
#     `def` is the keyword to tell Python you are defining a function.  It's like saying "Hey Python, listen up, I'm making a function here!"

#     ```python
def greet_person(name): # 'def' keyword starts function definition
    """This function greets the person passed in as a parameter.""" # Docstring - explains what function does
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome!") # Code inside the function
#     ```

# *   **Function Name - Identifier for Invocation:**
#     `greet_person` is the name of the function. You use this name to 'call' or 'run' the function later.
#     Choose names that clearly describe what the function does, like 'calculate_tax', 'send_email', etc.

# *   **Parameters (Inputs) - Interface Definition:**
#     `(name)` inside the parentheses are parameters. They are like placeholders for inputs.
#     In `greet_person(name)`, `name` is a parameter - it's waiting for you to give it a name when you use the function.

# *   **Function Body - Encapsulated Logic:**
#     The indented lines after `def` line are the function body. This is the actual code that runs when you call the function.
#     In `greet_person`, the function body is `print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome!")`.

# *   **`return` statement - Output Delivery (Optional):**
#     `return` is used to send a value back from the function.  Not all functions need to return something.
#     If there's no `return`, the function just does its job and doesn't send anything back directly.

#     ```python
def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    """This function adds two numbers and returns the sum."""
    sum_result = num1 + num2
    return sum_result # 'return' sends the sum back
#     ```

# *   **Calling (Invoking) Functions - Execution Trigger:**
#     To use a function, you need to 'call' it by its name and give it arguments (values for parameters).

#     ```python
greet_person("Alice") # Calling 'greet_person' function with argument "Alice"
#     Output: Hello, Alice! Welcome!

result = add_numbers(5, 3) # Calling 'add_numbers' with arguments 5 and 3
print(f"The sum is: {result}") # Output: The sum is: 8
#     ```

# *   **Reusability - Paradigm of Efficiency and Maintainability ‚ôªÔ∏è:**
#     The best part about functions is reusability. Write once, use many times!
#     If you need to do the same task in different parts of your code, just call the function again.
#     This makes your code shorter, easier to read, and easier to fix if there's a problem.

# **Visual Representation:**

# ```mermaid
# graph LR
#     subgraph Function Definition üì¶ (Blueprint)
#         A[def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):] --> B[    # Function Header];
#         B --> C[    """Docstring explaining function"""];
#         C --> D[    # Function body - code here];
#         D --> E[    return result  (Optional)];
#         style A fill:#e0f7fa,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
#         style B fill:#f0f4c3,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px

#         style E fill:#c8e6c9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
#     end
#     F[Function Call üõ†Ô∏è (Using the Blueprint)] --> G[function_name(argument1, argument2)];
#     G --> H[Execution of Function Body];
#     H --> I[Optional Return Value];
#     style F fill:#ffe0b2,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
#     style G fill:#ffe0b2,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
#     style H fill:#b2ebf2,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
#     style I fill:#fff9c4,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
# ```

# **Example - Function to check if a number is even:**
def is_even(number):
    """Checks if a number is even and returns True or False."""
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

num = 10
if is_even(num): # Calling the function 'is_even'
    print(f"{num} is an even number.")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not an even number.")

# **Summary:** Functions are reusable blocks of code. Define them using `def`, give them a name, parameters (optional), and a body of code.
# Call them by name to run the code. They can optionally return values. Makes code organized and reusable.

# ---

# ### 4.2 Function Parameters and Arguments (Inputs to Functions)

# **Concept:** Parameters and arguments are how you give input to functions.
# Parameters are like placeholders in the function definition, and arguments are the actual values you provide when you call the function.
# Think of it as filling out a form üìù.

# **Analogy:** Form with Fillable Slots üìù for Data Input

# Imagine a form you need to fill. The form has blank spaces (slots) for your name, age, etc.
# Parameters are like these blank spaces in the function definition.
# Arguments are the information you write in those spaces when you fill out the form (call the function).

# *   **Parameters as Placeholders üß∑:**
#     Parameters are the names listed in the function definition's parentheses. They are like variable names that will hold the input values.

# *   **Arguments as Filled-in Values üìù:**
#     Arguments are the actual values you pass to the function when you call it. These values get assigned to the parameters.

# **Explanation Breakdown (Technical Precision):**

# *   **Parameters - Formal Input Declarations:**
#     Parameters are the 'formal' names for inputs in the function definition. They tell you what kind of data the function expects.

# *   **Arguments - Actual Data Values Passed:**
#     Arguments are the 'actual' values you send to the function when you call it. These are the real data that the function will work with.

# *   **Positional Arguments - Order-Dependent Assignment:**
#     When you call a function, if you just give values without names, they are 'positional arguments'.
#     Python matches them to parameters based on their position (first to first, second to second, etc.).

#     ```python
def power(base, exponent): # 'base' and 'exponent' are parameters
    """Calculates base to the power of exponent."""
    return base ** exponent

result_pos = power(2, 3) # 2 is assigned to 'base', 3 to 'exponent' (positional)
print(f"2 raised to the power of 3 is: {result_pos}") # Output: 2 raised to the power of 3 is: 8
#     ```

# *   **Keyword Arguments - Name-Based Assignment (Order-Independent):**
#     You can also give arguments with parameter names, called 'keyword arguments'.
#     This way, the order doesn't matter, as Python knows which value belongs to which parameter by name.

#     ```python
result_keyword = power(exponent=3, base=2) # Order doesn't matter, names are used
print(f"2 raised to the power of 3 (keyword) is: {result_keyword}") # Output: 2 raised to the power of 3 (keyword) is: 8
#     ```

# *   **Default Parameter Values - Optional Argument Provision:**
#     You can give default values to parameters in the function definition.
#     If you don't provide an argument for a parameter with a default value when calling, it will use the default value.

#     ```python
def greet_with_message(name, message="Welcome!"): # 'message' has a default value
    """Greets a person with a custom message (default is 'Welcome!')."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}! {message}")

greet_with_message("Priya") # 'message' uses default value "Welcome!"
#     Output: Hello, Priya! Welcome!
greet_with_message("Rohan", "Good morning!") # 'message' is overridden with "Good morning!"
#     Output: Hello, Rohan! Good morning!
#     ```

# **Example - Function with multiple parameters:**
def describe_pet(animal_type, pet_name):
    """Describes a pet."""
    print(f"\nI have a {animal_type}.")
    print(f"My {animal_type}'s name is {pet_name}.")

describe_pet('hamster', 'Harry') # Positional arguments
describe_pet(animal_type='dog', pet_name='Lucy') # Keyword arguments
describe_pet('cat', pet_name='Bella') # Mixed - first positional, second keyword

# **Summary:** Parameters are placeholders in function definition, arguments are actual values when calling.
# Positional arguments are based on order, keyword arguments use parameter names. Default parameters are optional.
# Parameters and arguments are essential for passing data into functions to make them flexible.

# ### 4.3 Return Values: Function Outputs üì§ (Results of Actions)

# **Concept:** Return values are how functions give back results after doing their job.
# It's like the output of a machine or the answer to a question.
# If a function calculates something or processes data, it usually 'returns' the result.

# **Analogy:** Vending Machine Output Chute üì§ for Product Delivery

# Think of a vending machine. You put in money (input), the machine processes it, and then it gives you a snack (output).
# Return values are like the snack that the function (vending machine) gives you after you give it inputs (arguments).

# *   **Arguments as Coins ü™ô (Inputs):**
#     Arguments you pass to a function are like the coins you put into a vending machine.

# *   **Function Code as Machine Processing ‚öôÔ∏è:**
#     The code inside the function is like the machinery inside the vending machine that processes your request.

# *   **Return Value as Output Product üç´ (Result):**
#     The `return` value is like the snack that comes out of the vending machine - the result of the function's work.

# **Explanation Breakdown (Technical Precision):**

# *   **`return` keyword - Explicit Output Specification:**
#     The `return` keyword in a function is used to specify what value the function should send back to the part of the code that called it.

# *   **Return Data Types - Versatility of Outputs:**
#     Functions can return values of any data type - numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, even other functions!
#     This makes functions very powerful and flexible.

# *   **Implicit `None` Return - Default Output Behavior:**
#     If a function doesn't have a `return` statement, or if it just says `return` without a value, it implicitly returns `None`.
#     `None` means 'no value' or 'nothing'. It's like the vending machine giving you nothing if it's out of stock.

# *   **Purpose of Return Values - Composition and Data Flow:**
#     Return values are important because they allow you to use the output of one function as input to another function, or to store the result for later use.
#     This is how you build complex programs by combining simple functions.

# **Example Illustration:**

def get_full_name(first_name, last_name):
    """Combines first and last name and returns the full name."""
    full_name = f"{first_name} {last_name}"
    return full_name # Returns the constructed full name

def greet_full_name(first, last):
    """Greets a person by their full name using get_full_name function."""
    name = get_full_name(first, last) # Call get_full_name and use its return value
    print(f"Greetings, {name}!")

greet_full_name("Shahrukh", "Khan") # Call greet_full_name, which uses get_full_name internally
# Output: Greetings, Shahrukh Khan!

# **Example - Function with no explicit return (returns None):**
def print_message(message):
    """Prints a message to the console. No explicit return."""
    print(message)
    # No 'return' statement here - implicitly returns None

result_none = print_message("This function returns None.")
print(f"Return value of print_message: {result_none}") # Output: Return value of print_message: None

# **Summary:** `return` statement sends values back from a function. Functions can return any type of data or None.
# Return values allow you to use function results in other parts of your code, making functions building blocks for larger programs.
