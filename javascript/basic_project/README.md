### 1. **Distributed Task Queue Manager**  
**Problem:** In large-scale back-end systems, you need a reliable way to distribute CPU-intensive jobs (e.g., image processing, data analytics) across multiple worker processes while exposing a unified HTTP API.  
**Requirements:**  
- Accept job submissions via an HTTP endpoint.  
- Queue incoming jobs in memory (with persistence fallback to disk).  
- Spawn `n` worker processes automatically on server start (based on CPU count).  
- Distribute queued jobs to idle workers, track progress, retries on failure.  
- Expose status and metrics (jobs queued, running, failed) via HTTP.  
**Modules:** `http`, `cluster`, `child_process`, `os`, `fs`, `events`

### 2. **High-Performance UDP Log Aggregator**  
**Problem:** A microservices ecosystem emits high-volume logs via UDP packets. You need a collector that reliably receives, de-duplicates, batches, compresses, and forwards them to durable storage (e.g., S3).  
**Requirements:**  
- Listen for JSON-encoded log records on a configurable UDP port.  
- Detect and discard duplicates (based on unique IDs).  
- Batch messages for up to 100 ms or 1000 entries, whichever comes first.  
- Compress each batch with gzip.  
- Upload batches asynchronously via HTTPS to the storage endpoint.  
- Provide back-pressure handling if storage is unavailable.  
**Modules:** `dgram`, `zlib`, `https`, `timers`, `crypto`, `events`

### 3. **Encrypted Peer-to-Peer File Sync Tool**  
**Problem:** Users want a CLI utility that synchronizes directories across machines over the Internet, encrypted end-to-end, without a central server.  
**Requirements:**  
- Command-line client that watches a local directory for changes.  
- Connect to peers via TCP or UTP fallback.  
- Exchange directory metadata, diff files.  
- Encrypt files in transit using asymmetric keys and sign packets.  
- Resume interrupted transfers seamlessly.  
- Provide a REPL interface for peer management.  
**Modules:** `fs`, `net`, `crypto`, `readline`, `events`, `stream`, `tls`, `url`, `querystring`

### 4. **Real-Time Performance Monitoring Dashboard**  
**Problem:** Operations teams need real-time insights into Node.js service performance metrics (event-loop lag, memory, CPU usage) visualized in the browser.  
**Requirements:**  
- Instrument process with `perf_hooks` and `os` to sample CPU, memory, GC, and event-loop delay.  
- Serve a WebSocket endpoint streaming metrics at 1 s intervals.  
- Host a static HTML/JS dashboard that plots live charts.  
- Implement rolling window storage of the last 5 minutes in memory with circular buffer.  
- Secure access via token in URL.  
**Modules:** `http`, `ws` (via `require('http').Server` + `crypto` for tokens), `perf_hooks`, `os`, `fs`, `path`, `url`

### 5. **Dynamic DNS-Based Load Balancer**  
**Problem:** Create a TCP load balancer that regularly resolves a service’s DNS name to discover healthy backend IPs and balances incoming connections accordingly.  
**Requirements:**  
- Accept incoming TCP connections on a fixed port.  
- Every 30 s, resolve a configurable hostname to get a fresh IP list.  
- Perform health checks (TCP handshake) before adding to the pool.  
- Distribute new connections in round-robin fashion.  
- Gracefully close connections to backends going offline.  
- Log metrics and errors to rotating log files.  
**Modules:** `net`, `dns`, `timers`, `fs`, `console`, `events`

---

### 6. **CLI-Driven Interactive Shell with Plugin System**  
**Problem:** Developers need a customizable REPL shell that supports third-party plugins, auto-completion, and context-aware helpers.  
**Requirements:**  
- Launch a REPL that exposes core APIs and `require` sandboxed.  
- Support plugin discovery from a `plugins/` directory; load/unload at runtime.  
- Provide tab-completion based on loaded plugins and their commands.  
- Log command history to disk.  
- Handle uncaught errors per-context without crashing the shell.  
**Modules:** `repl`, `vm`, `fs`, `path`, `readline`, `domain` (for legacy error isolation), `events`

---

### 7. **Secure File Upload and Processing Pipeline**  
**Problem:** Build an HTTPS service for large file uploads (multi-part), virus-scan each file, generate thumbnails for images, transcode videos, then store outputs.  
**Requirements:**  
- Accept streaming multi-part uploads to avoid buffering entire file in memory.  
- Stream each part through a virus-scan (simulate via a child process).  
- If media, spawn worker processes to generate thumbnails (images) or convert video formats.  
- Store originals and outputs in a directory hierarchy.  
- Expose progress and result via WebSocket or SSE.  
- Enforce request size limits and authentication.  
**Modules:** `https`, `stream`, `crypto`, `child_process`, `fs`, `path`, `tls`, `events`, `util`

---

### 8. **Lightweight In-Memory Cache with Persistence**  
**Problem:** Some applications need a simple in-process key–value cache with TTL, LRU eviction, and optional disk persistence for restart recovery.  
**Requirements:**  
- Expose `get`, `set`, `delete`, and `clear` operations via a JS API.  
- Support per-key TTL and global max size with LRU eviction.  
- On process exit or at intervals, serialize the cache to disk atomically.  
- On startup, load and validate persisted data.  
- Emit events on hits, misses, evictions.  
**Modules:** `events`, `timers`, `fs`, `path`, `os`, `util`

---

### 9. **Modular HTTP/2 API Gateway with Rate Limiting**  
**Problem:** Route HTTP/2 API calls to multiple microservices, enforce per-client rate limits, and provide detailed analytics.  
**Requirements:**  
- Terminate HTTP/2 TLS connections.  
- Read request path and proxy to backend based on routing rules (config file).  
- Track requests per client IP with configurable window and limit.  
- Reject excess with HTTP/2 RST_STREAM and JSON error.  
- Log each request (method, path, status, latency) to a structured log file.  
- Hot-reload configuration without restart.  
**Modules:** `http2`, `tls`, `fs`, `path`, `net`, `events`, `crypto`, `console`, `util`

---

### 10. **Custom VM-Based Script Sandbox for Untrusted Code**  
**Problem:** You need to allow users to upload and run JavaScript “plugins” in isolation, with limited access to the host environment and resource usage caps.  
**Requirements:**  
- Accept JS code via API or CLI.  
- Create a new `vm.Context` with only whitelisted globals (e.g., `console`, specific helper libs).  
- Impose CPU and memory limits per script (via timing out execution and monitoring heap usage).  
- Provide safe, stubbed I/O APIs (e.g., in-memory filesystem or controlled network stub).  
- Capture stdout, stderr per script, with size caps.  
- Tear down contexts cleanly after execution.  
**Modules:** `vm`, `timers`, `events`, `crypto` (for audit logs), `util`, `fs` (for stubs)
