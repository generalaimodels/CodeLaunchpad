        *   **Run-time Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism):**
            *   Virtual functions:  Functions declared as `virtual` in the base class.  Derived classes can override them, and the correct version is called at runtime based on the object's actual type (even if accessed through a base class pointer or reference).
            *   Abstract classes and pure virtual functions:  Classes that cannot be instantiated directly, used as interfaces, defining a common structure for derived classes.
*   **Concept:**  Virtual Functions and Dynamic Binding 🎭🔗
    *   **Analogy:**  Imagine a stage play 🎭 with different actors playing the role of "King".  The script (interface - "speak() method") is the same, but each actor (derived class object) performs it in their own style (implementation - overridden virtual function). Dynamic binding means deciding which actor (implementation) to use at show time (runtime).
    *   **Emoji:** 🎭🔗⏱️ (Roles, connection, runtime decision)
    *   **Details:**
        *   `virtual` keyword.

*   **Concept:**  Allocating Memory When You Need It 🧠📦
    *   **Analogy:**  Imagine needing to rent storage space 📦 only when you have extra stuff to store, and then returning it when you're done. Dynamic memory allocation is like renting memory from the computer's memory manager when you need it, and then freeing it up when you're finished.
    *   **Emoji:** 📦➡️🧠➡️📦 (Need memory -> Ask Memory Manager -> Get Memory)
    *   **Details:**

        *   Device drivers (brief introduction - more advanced topic).
        *   System programming is often platform-specific (code may need to be adapted for different operating systems).
*   **Concept:**  Building System-Level Applications 💻🛠️
    *   **Analogy:**  Building tools that interact directly with the operating system or hardware.
    *   **Emoji:** 💻🛠️➡️⚙️ (System Tools -> OS Mechanisms)
    *   **Details:**
        *   Writing command-line utilities.
        *   Creating daemons or services (background processes).
        *   Developing low-level system libraries.
        *   Interfacing with hardware devices (requires more specialized knowledge).
        *   System programming often requires a deeper understanding of operating system internals and computer architecture.
